This is a template-project, which uses Spring 4, Spring Security 3 and has a REST-interface for serving json-data.

** IT IS NOT WORKING UP TO NOW **

The template uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org) for dependency management and is based on the following libs:

* jackson
* hibernate
* h2
* jsonpath

It also provides the tomcat-plugin (with an embedded tomcat)


In [build.gradle](build.gradle) there is a special section with all the used versions; see at the beginning of the dependencies-section.
